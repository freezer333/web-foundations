            Here's some examples of inline text element which
            <span>do not change the vertical layout of the text</span>, but
            <em>may change the visual appearance</em>. The visual appearance is
            <strong>completely defined by the browser</strong>, and is allowed
            to be different across different browsers and devices.

            The <big>long</big> and <small>short</small> of the story is that
            these are so common, they really couldn't be dropped. Most people
            use CSS instead, but they are valid.

        <pre><code>
        int <var>x</var> = 5;
        int <var>y</var> = 10;

        cout << "The sum is:  " << <var>x</var> + <var>y</var> << endl;
        </code>
        </pre>
        <samp> The sum is: 15 </samp>

        <h1>Three paragraphs</h1>

            The br element in HTML represents a line break, used to insert a new
            line within text without starting a new paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't require a closing tag.
        </p>
        <p>
            The br element is often used within blocks of text or inside other
            elements to control formatting and improve readability.
