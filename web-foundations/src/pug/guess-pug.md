# Guessing Game Version 4 - Templates
We've come a long way, and we are about to write one of our *shortest* versions of the Guessing game, at least in terms of the number of lines of code within our main JavaScript code file.  We'll make use of our `Game` class logic, the `GuessingDatabase` class to do database work, and now the `pug` library to move the HTML generation out of our JavaScript code.  The result will be a far more readable program!

Let's start by listing out what we will be using from before.  We won't list out the full code, because these files will be *unchanged* from the last time we saw them.



To install these, we do our `npm install llllllllll`

We'll also install `pug` with `npm install pug`.

Now let's look the main program code.


Our template files are as follows:


## Mixins and Includes

- List guesses, with secret, to determine response in mixin
- Add guesses to the guess page
- Layout
