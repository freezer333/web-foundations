## JavaScript, everywhere?
This book uses JavaScript as a server side language, running within the Node.js runtime environment.  This choice is somewhat controversial - since there are wonderful frameworks and support for many programming languages on the backend.  No question, the use of .NET ASP MVC, Python, Java, Rust, Ruby on Rails, Go and many others could be more than justified.  The truth is that you can find just about any programming language being used professionally on the backend - and many applications use a mix of languages!

I have chosen JavaScript for no reason other than this:  *If you are new to web development*, you **must** learn JavaScript for client-side browser-based development.  Learning multiple programming languages at the same time obscures concepts - and concepts are what this book is about.  In teaching web development to undergraduate university students for over a dozen years, I’ve found that using JavaScript limits the overhead in learning web topics.  If you already know the JavaScript language, this book will give you a tour-de-force in web development concepts - without needing to learn a new language.  If you *are* new to JavaScript, this book should give you enough of a primer while teaching you the backend such that by the time we cover client side programming, you’ll be able to focus on concepts and not syntax.  Once you learn the concepts of web development, you won’t have trouble moving to other languages on the backend if you prefer.

There are other arguments made for JavaScript on the backend, such as sharing code between server and front end runtimes, and the suitability of JavaScript’s I/O model for backend web development.  These arguments have some validity, but they aren’t universally agreed to by any stretch.  We use JavaScript here for no other reason but to flatten the **learning curve**.

## Organization
This book teaches web development almost in the order in which things developed - first focusing on networks, hypertext, markup and server side rendering.  You will be introduced to JavaScript early on when, just before we begin processing input from users.  We will build frameworks around HTML templating, databases, routing, and other common backend tasks - only to have our homegrown implementations replaces with Express.  The Express framework was chosen for its relative stability and ubiquity, among the many frameworks in use within the Node.js ecosystem.

Only after we have a full web application up and running do we begin to turn our attention towards styling and interactivity.  CSS is introduced approximately midway through the text book, and client side JavaScript makes up the majority of the final half dozen chapters.  This book will show you the differences between traditional web applications, single page applications, and cover hybrid approaches that adhere to **H**ypertext **a**s **t**he **e**ngine **o**f **a**pplication **s**tate (HATEOAS) philosophy, while still providing interactive (and incrementally/partially rendered) user interfaces.  Along the way, we will cover things like local storage, PWAs, web sockets, and reactivity.

The Appendices and Perspectives sections at the end of the text are optional components aimed towards filling in some of the details different readers may be wondering about.  The goal of the entire textbook, in fact, is to do this that - **fill in the gaps** - by providing a comprehensive overview of web development.
