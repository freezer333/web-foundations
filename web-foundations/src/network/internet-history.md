# Internet History

Talk about early protocols on the internet.

Growth of IP, TCP, UDP.

Where did HTTP come from.

Some early HTTP servers.  

Then the major players now - apache, msiis, and nginx.  Talk about how they relate to *application servers* in the real world.  

Close out with explaining how mostly, web development is done with a regular language on the frontend before deployment - but that one of the major http servers usually acts as a go-between in production.  Refer to production chapter.
