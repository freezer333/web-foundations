# What, Who, Why
This book is not a comprehensive reference for any programming language - although you will see quite a lot of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.   This book **is** a comprehensive guide to web development concepts - including server side (backend) and client side (front end) development, and most things in between.  We will keep our attention on the design of the web architecture, concepts that remain constant across so many of the programming languages, frameworks, and acronyms you’ve probably heard about.  This book won’t play favorites - you’ll see how different architectural styles like **S**ingle **P**age **A**pplications (SPA) differs from **S**erver **S**ide **R**endering (SSR), how **R**epresentational **S**tate **T**ransfer (REST) using JSON differs from Hypertext as the engine of application state (HATEOAS), and how conventional “roll your own” CSS can blend with full styling frameworks.  This book covers the **full** stack.

If you are a beginner in computer science and programming, you are in for a ride - a fun one.  We won’t assume you know advanced programming concepts, but we will move quickly - you will be challenged if you haven’t done much software development.  One promise I can make is that you won’t walk away with shallow knowledge though - we will cover concepts from the ground up, which will allow you to pick up new trends in web development as they arise - well after you are done reading this book.  You won’t be taught **one** way of doing things, only to be left feeling lost when the next web framework becomes the new hotness of the world.

For seasoned developers new to web development, you might be surprised to learn web development doesn’t have to be the fad-obsessed, inefficient "Wild West" it can sometimes appear to be.  The essentials of web development *can* be grounded in solid software engineering, and *can* be simple - if not always easy.  

This book is written for university students and professionals alike.  If you’ve already done some work in web development, you will likely still learn a lot from seeing things presented from a foundational perspective.  Once you’ve mastered the concepts presented here, you will be better able to make use of new development trends, and make better connections between the acronym soup you encounter as you dive deeper into the discipline.
