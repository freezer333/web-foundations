# Part 3
We can think of web development as two main branches of development: client-side (frontend) and serverside (backend), with HTTP being the network protocol that glues them together.  On the front end, HTML is foundational - we don't have web pages without HTML.  Part 1 of this book covered the core technology - HTML, HTTP, and server side development.  Part 2 refined our approach on the backend.  We went from writing extremely basic and limited web servers to using Express, Pug Templates, Databases.  We implemented state managements (cookies, sessions) and authentication.

Now it's time to jump over to the *other side*.  **Client side**.  Our web pages don't have any style yet - and we're going to change that with CSS.  Our web pages are completely static, and we are going to learn to change that with *client side* JavaScript.  Along the way, we'll see modern CSS framworks, learn *responsive design* and how to target multiple devices.  We'll take a look a modern JavaScript frameworks (Vue) and architecture patters (Single Page Applications) along with HTMX and the HATEOS movement.
